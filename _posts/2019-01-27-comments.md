I just used the already installed disqus tools.
I just followed the guide on the disqus site for the jekyll platform.

By creating an account on the disqus-website i got a shortname to enter in my config.yml.
Now i can turn on or off comments on my post in the frontmatter-block of every post, by setting the "comments" line to true or false.
