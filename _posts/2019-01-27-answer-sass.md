+ What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?  
  - Compare to regular CSS
  - Which techniques did you use?
  - Pros and cons?

I think sass is really hard to use compared to regular css. But i can absolutely see why developers use it.  
I mean the reason why i think it was so hard is because i only been playing around with ordinary css and i just know the workflow better.

I created varibles to change the colors on different parts of the site (header, nav, text etc.)
I also created a very small .scss file to test importing it.

#### Pros and Cons

I can absolutely see how the varibles, nesting and importing, just to name a few, can be powerful tools to make my code more efficient and shorter, especially in bigger projects. It makes making varibles easier. And importing things cleaner and easier so i could seperate my css in smaller files so they become easier to work with.

But today i think the learningcurve  is the biggest con. You need to learn a new syntax and new techologies.
And today i can't justify it when i could do most of it in oldschool css (just not as clean).
