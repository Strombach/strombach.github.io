+ What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

The robots.txt file tells the search-engines crawlers what pages or files on my server they are allowed or not allowed to visit or request.

For example if googles crawlers visits my server 1000000 times every day it could overload my server because all the requests and block my customers to enjoy my site.

I set up my robots.txt so the crawlers from all search engines know that they are not welcome in my src or vendor folder on my server.
