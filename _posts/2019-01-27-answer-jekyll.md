+ What do you think of static site generators?
  - What type of projects are they suitable for?


Just as css-pre-processors i think the learningcurve is quite big, but i think this tool is more useful.

For example to split all the different parts of the site into all smaller different parts so i could write my html into smaller files and don't have to repeat my code for my navbar in every html-document to make it look the same all over my website.

I think a ssg is perfect for projects where the content is changed alot, like blogs or webstores.  
If i want to add a new post or product i don't want to startover buidling a new document for that post or product, when i could just add a md file with the new content and the ssg generates a new page for me.
